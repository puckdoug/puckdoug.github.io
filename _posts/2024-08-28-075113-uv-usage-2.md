This post follows on from [UV Usage](/uv-usage/) written a few days ago, where I wrote about about moving to using UV and the commonly-used commands: run, add, remove. Here I'll cover adding it to an existing project, which is what I did. Creating one from scratch is pretty well covered in [the documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/).

In the case of zpdatafetch, I wasn't starting clean. I had an existing pyproject.toml. I decided to start just adding things to see how it worked.

Since the venv was not set up in the way that `uv` would build it, I simply removed it entirely to start clean. Then I tried `uv init`. This didn't work:

```shell
error: Project is already initialized in `/Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch`
```

So, I decided to just add the dependencies and see what happened. This also failed, but seemed to be moving in the right direction:

```shell
$ uv add beautifulsoup4 httpx lxml keyring keyrings-alt

warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.12`.
error: Failed to build: `zpdatafetch @ file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch`
  Caused by: Build backend failed to determine extra requires with `build_editable()` with exit status: 1
--- stdout:
configuration error: You cannot provide a value for `project.dependencies` and list it under `project.dynamic` at the same time
DESCRIPTION:
    According to PEP 621:  Build back-ends MUST raise an error if the metadata
    specifies a field statically as well as being listed in dynamic.

GIVEN VALUE:

        "dependencies": [
            "beautifulsoup4",
            "httpx",

            "keyring"
        ],
        "...": " # ...",
        "dynamic": [

            "dependencies"
        ]
    }

```

In this case, the problem was that I had dependencies listed in the dynamic section of the pyproject.toml. I removed them and tried again:

```shell
$ uv add beautifulsoup4 httpx lxml keyring keyrings-alt
warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.12`.
Resolved 23 packages in 3.54s
   Built zpdatafetch @ file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch

 + anyio==4.4.0

 + certifi==2024.7.4
 + h11==0.14.0

 + sniffio==1.3.1
 + soupsieve==2.6
 + zpdatafetch==1.1.0 (from file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch)
```

Bingo!. So next the dev dependencies:

```shell
$ uv add --dev pytest ruff setuptools build wheel
warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.12`.
Resolved 33 packages in 3.22s
warning: No `requires-python` value found in the workspace. Defaulting to `>=3.12`.
   Built zpdatafetch @ file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch

 + setuptools==74.0.0
 + wheel==0.44.0
 ~ zpdatafetch==1.1.0 (from file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch)
```

In both cases the system is giving a warning about the python version. I have tested 3.10 and up. So I added the requirement to the project section:

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.10"
```

And then ran `uv sync` and he that seemed to take care of the issue:

```shell
$ uv sync
Resolved 39 packages in 3.08s
   Built zpdatafetch @ file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch
Prepared 1 package in 3.10s
Uninstalled 1 package in 3ms
Installed 1 package in 13ms
 ~ zpdatafetch==1.1.0 (from file:///Users/doug/Development/Zwift/zpd/zpdatafetch)
```

At this point, not only were all my dependencies installed, but I had a working install set up in my venv. The zpdata command, which is installed as an executable with the package, was installed in `.venv/bin` along with the other tools from the dependencies: `pytest`, `httpx`, `keyring`, `ruff`, etc.

A quick test showed that the command installed and works:

```shell
$ uv run zpdata -h
usage: zpdata [-h] [-v] [{config,cyclist,primes,result,signup,team}] [id ...]

Module for fetching zwiftpower data using the Zwifpower API

positional arguments:
  {config,cyclist,primes,result,signup,team}
                        which command to run
  id                    the id to search for, ignored for config

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         provide feedback while running
```

All other commands work as expected under `uv run` as well.

In the next update, I'll write about how I integrated uv into github actions and published the next version of [zpdatafetch](https://pypi.org/project/zpdatafetch/) with uv.
