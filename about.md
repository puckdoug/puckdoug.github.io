# A bit about me

I started working on computers at a time when they didn't necessarily come with an operating system. I work on hardware
and software projects, depending on the client or day.

In my spare time, I ride a bike, among other things. Because of work and family commitments, I spend a good deal of time
on [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/). In that virtual world, I get to pair both the biking and programming by being one of
the organizers (and the backend developer) of the [DIRT Racing Series](https://dirtracingseries.com).
